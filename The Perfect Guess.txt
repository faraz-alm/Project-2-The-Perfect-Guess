Write a Program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.

If the Player's guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays "Aim Lower".
Similarly, if the user's guess is too low, the program prints "Aim Larger". When the user guesses
the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive
at the number.

Also, update the high score of the player in a .txt file.
